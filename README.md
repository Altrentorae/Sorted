This was made for a Programming class on the topic of sorting algorithms.
Some algorithms are non-functional, some are not optimised to perfection. The project is provided as it was on the day of submission and will receive no updates to the code.

To run this simple program, clone this repo, open the .sln with visual studio, and build the project.
